Design goals of this repo:

 - Bring user to goal as fast as possible, leaving completeness to other documents
 - But include some skippable tips/tricks that would be hard to discover under normal problem-solving conditions
 - A short list of tasks (focused on advanced/useful examples)
 - Relevant hints for each task, brief tutorials and tips interspersed
 - Solutions included in separate files to improve experience of **trying solution yourself** (I had noticed that when the solution is right before my eyes, as in some other tutorials/notebooks, it removes the fun of trying to come up with the solution myself, so a slight degree of separation seems desirable, and having reference solutions is useful).

Module comments:
 - For python standard lib modules, comment with #standard
 - For modules that need to be installed, comment with #install
 - For modules that are included as files under nova/ directory, comment with #included as .py



Outline:
 - 01 Manipulating numpy arrays and 1-D plots
 - 02 Loading data (numpy.loadtxt, h5py.File)
 - 03 Reducing 3-D data for our 2-D retinae (matplotlib imshow/pcolormesh)
